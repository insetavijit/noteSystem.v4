Forex, short for **foreign exchange**, is the global market where currencies are traded against each other. It’s the largest and most liquid financial market, with daily trading volumes exceeding $7 trillion. In forex trading, you buy one currency while selling another, aiming to profit from changes in their exchange rates. For example, if you believe the euro (EUR) will strengthen against the US dollar (USD), you might buy EUR/USD, hoping to sell it later at a higher price.

Key points for understanding forex trading:
- **Currency Pairs**: Traded in pairs like EUR/USD or GBP/JPY. The first currency is the "base," the second is the "quote." The price shows how much of the quote currency you need to buy one unit of the base.
- **Market Drivers**: Exchange rates move due to economic data (like GDP or inflation), interest rates, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.
- **Leverage**: Forex often involves leverage, letting you control large positions with small capital, but it amplifies both profits and losses.
- **[[Participants]]**: Include banks, institutions, retail traders, and brokers. Retail traders access forex through online platforms.
- **Trading Hours**: 24/5, starting Sunday evening and closing Friday afternoon (UTC).

For someone new to forex trading, start with:
1. **Learning Basics**: Understand terms like pips (smallest price move), lots (trade size), and spread (broker’s fee).
2. **Demo Accounts**: Practice with virtual money on platforms like MetaTrader or TradingView.
3. **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital per trade to avoid big losses.
4. **Strategy**: Study technical analysis (charts, indicators) or fundamental analysis (economic news) to guide trades.

If you’re trying to trade forex, focus on major pairs like EUR/USD for lower spreads and volatility. Be cautious of high leverage and always use stop-loss orders to limit losses. Want me to dive deeper into any part, like strategies or specific pairs?
